We should have sunny days, some cold nights, and maybe some hours of rain. Therefore, it is advisable to wear high sun protection cream, sunglasses and gloves.</p>

																<p>Car traffic in Bhutan is very scarce and only appears in the vicinity of urban areas. One drives to the left and one adapts to driving rules quickly. Most of the roads are paved and are in a good general condition although we can do some kilometers of track.
This circuit is intermediate level for a biker with experience in mountain roads.

Bhutan is an amazing country full of magic, but it is not an easy country for those who do not have patience or are not accustomed to unforeseen events and delays. If you decide to join the group, keep in mind that you will have to be flexible with unexpected situations and possible delays due to the special conditions of the country. As I imagine you will know, this type of motorcycle adventure carries a certain risk that when I come to the trip I suppose you are aware of it and accept. Having a good disposition and a good dose of humor are essential to fully enjoy this trip.

																<p>The Royal Enfield is still manufactured in India after the English house stopped producing them in England in the mid-1950s. The bikes continue with the same design 60 years ago, with few aesthetic or technical changes. It is a sturdy motorcycle with an unsurpassed look and sound. With the change reversed and a 500cc engine the Enfield will give you a pleasure from another era when you drive it on Indian roads. If the Enfield is not a fast motorcycle it is the one that best adapts to the harsh conditions of the roads in this part of the world.</p>

<p>Our Royal Enfield motorcycle fleet consists of 500cc motorcycles, 5-speed gearbox, European gearbox and disc brake and electric starter.
